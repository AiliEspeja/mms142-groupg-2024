          <!-- SECTION 1: What is Disruptive Tech? -->
          <h2>What is Disruptive Technology?</h2>
          <p>
            Now let’s tackle what exactly is Disruptive Technology? What does it
            take for something to be labeled ‘disruptive’. We mentioned earlier
            that oftentimes this term is misused… but how and why? It was
            actually coined by Harvard Business School professor Clayton
            Christensesn in the year 1995; according to him, Disruptive
            Technology, also known as Disruptive Innovation, refers to a new
            business model that targets an underserved market, ultimately
            growing to challenge and displace established competitors. In
            simpler terms? Try to think about something that absolutely
            revolutionized how things used to be. Later on, we’d be able to list
            tons of examples. <br />
            <br />
            You might think,
            <i
              >Wow! So to create these Disruptive Technologies, companies must
              have and use top of the line technology.</i
            >
            Well, not exactly. Most of the time, DTs come from start-up
            companies. These new competitors have studied the market and noticed
            that current competitors focus on catering to high-end products,
            leaving an opportunity in the lower-end markets for them. Why do
            current competitors focus on high-end products? That’s because the
            low-end market harvests low-profits. Often, new competitors succeed
            in their endeavors to cater to the low-end market, and eventually
            become leading competitors themselves. Did they use top of the line
            technology for this? Sometimes. But the important highlight is not
            the superior technology but rather the thoughtfulness of the
            innovation. Some innovations are so revolutionary that the entire
            industry has to evolve in order to continue competing to better meet
            customer needs.
          </p>
          <!-- SECTION 2: What are some examples? -->
          <h2>What are some Examples?</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we have an idea of what Disruptive Technologies are, let’s
            clarify further with some examples:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Smartphones <br>
            2. Amazon <br>
            3. Healthcare <br>
            4. Uber <br>
            5. Netflix <br>
            6. Airbnb <br>
            7. Tesla <br>
            8. Spotify <br>
            9. Apple <br>
            10. Artificial Intelligence
          </p>
          <p>
            You might say,
            <i
              >Hold the phone! Apple? Amazon? But these are Big Tech! The
              largest and most influential technology companies in the world.</i
            >
            Yes, but they didn’t start off like that. Once upon a time, Amazon
            was founded in a garage in 1994, as an online bookstore which only
            sold its first book in 1995. Now, it’s like a global superpower that
            sells a multitude of products and services worldwide. Revolutionary?
            Yes. Amazon has deeply made an impact on daily human life in the
            USA, especially.<br />
            <br />
            Smartphones changed communication for everybody. Platforms like
            Amazon and Netflix enhanced shopping and entertainment by
            prioritizing convenience and personalization. Businesses must adapt
            to these changes, using technology and fostering innovation to stay
            relevant. Real-world examples show how disruptive technology works.
            Tesla has changed the car industry with electric vehicles and
            charging networks, while Airbnb has altered travel by connecting
            people with hosts for different lodging options. In finance and
            healthcare, advancements in artificial intelligence are improving
            efficiency through automation and personalized services. By studying
            these examples, companies can learn the importance of focusing on
            customers by being adaptable, and embracing new technologies to
            remain competitive in a fast-changing market. Now, are all new
            innovations considered disruptive? No. Some are called sustaining
            technologies. These help established companies improve gradually.
            Let’s have a look at a smartphone as an example. The smartphone?
            That’s a disruptive innovation. The smartphone case and accessories?
            That’s a very good example of a sustaining technology.
