      <h2> What does this mean for us? </h2>
      <p> We are at the advent of on-demand services being the status quo. The world cries for convenience and speed; everything they want needs to be readily available at the click of a finger. We have services in the States like Uber and Netflix becoming a big part of their daily lives. These social changes and higher customer expectations have driven the growth of on-demand services, with a significant increase in users.

Focusing on Southeast Asia, Grab has profoundly influenced urban mobility by offering these readily accessible ride-hailing and delivery services while simultaneously addressing deficiencies within public transportation networks. Grab’s transformative role showcases the potential of the technology to bridge gaps in urban transportation, economic development, and environmental sustainability. However, there are challenges such as traffic congestion, rural accessibility, worker’s rights and urban emissions. This requires collaborative effort among Grab, policymakers, and society to ensure equitable and sustainable growth.
